# Contributing to MyNN

If you're interested in helping out the project, there are a few things you can do:

### Reporting issues

If you notice any issues in behavior, please do [open an
issue](https://github.com/davidmascharka/MyNN/issues/new) and try to include as much information as
you can about your system and the issue. Include things like operating system, NumPy and MyGrad
versions, Python version, and any other relevant information. Please do note that _Python 2 is not
supported_, so please do not open issues for Python 2.

### Contributing code

If you're interested in improving the library, there are a few places to start. First, familiarize
yourself with the code and documentation styles used in MyNN. Pull requests that don't conform to
these will be asked for changes until they do conform.

Be aware that excellent documentation is one of the hallmarks of MyNN. Code submissions that do not
(well) document will not be accepted.

If you're new to contributing, issues labeled as [good first
issue](https://github.com/davidmascharka/MyNN/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are an excellent place to start.

##### Submitting code

When you open a pull request, please ensure that you've used sensible, clear commit messages that
convey exactly what each commit does. Further, please ensure that commits are squashed so that we
can keep our git history (relatively) clean and clear. Please try to keep to one pull request for
one feature and ensure you're working off of master for each PR to avoid conflicts. MyNN is intended
largely as a teaching tool, so we the maintainers are happy to work with you to fine-tune your PR
and get your code to the point that it fits in with MyNN. Even if you're in doubt, if you've tried
to follow the conventions listed out here and are open to feedback, submit a PR and we'll work
together.
